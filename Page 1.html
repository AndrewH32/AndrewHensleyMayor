	   <p>"I'm Andrew J. Hensley, candidate for Mayor of the City of Arvada. I stand before you proud to serve as your mayor. I've met with Arvada residents in their kitchens, backyards, and businesses, and the one resounding message I heard over and over again is that Arvada is ready. Ready to turn challenges into opportunities for a brighter future; ready to jumpstart our economy; and ready for Arvada to take its rightful place as one of the premier cities in the United States and around the globe.

Now is the time for all of us to come together to turn our dreams and aspirations into reality. I'm honored to be your choice for Mayor and eager to work with you to move Arvada forward." </p>
		
       <p>Arvada, like many U.S. cities, has faced it's share of difficulties in 2020. But just like we've done before, I'm confident we're going to bounce back stronger qnd as we face what's ahead, whether it's COVID-19 or an economic crisis — we're stronger together.</p>

       <p>With an equity-focused approach, Candidate Hensley has prioritized investing in Arvada's children and youth. He has started a plan to invest in affordable housing and double funding for services for those experiencing homelessness. Hiring more police and firefighters to keep city residents safe is vital. Hensley embraces technology as a Smart City to make government resources work smarter and more impactfully for residents. Candidate Hensley will push Arvada forward as a regional leader. He plans to secure direct international flights to Denver International Airport positioning the city to do business all over the world and create jobs here in the city. Under candidate Hensley's leadership, Arvada will become known as a top U.S. city for startups, especially minority and women-owned businesses, one of the best places to live and is working to make sure that all residents, no matter which background they represent, can experience the success that Arvada will experience.</p>
